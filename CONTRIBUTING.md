# Contributing

We welcome pull requests for everything, including documentation, tests, features, and comments. We are very new-contributor friendly and if we don't accept your request, we will
try to provide helpful feedback, bandwidth permitted.

We have a strict `no jerks` rule. Be respectful and understand that there are often many solutions to a given problem or feature. No one is perfect and people make mistakes or don't know what they don't know. Treat everyone with respect and dignity.

First, fork, then clone the repository:

    git clone git@github.com:kevineaton/drs-sdk.git

Set up the library using the README steps. Please make sure all tests pass and that any new features include relevant tests. Not sure how to write tests? No problem, just ask and we can try our best to help you!

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].

As always, open an issue if you find a bug or problem!

If you make a pull request, feel free to add your information to our CONTRIBUTORS.md file!
