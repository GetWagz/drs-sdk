# Amazon Dash Replenishment Service SDK for Go

This library serves as a simple SDK for the Amazon Dash Replenishment Service. While trying to integrate with DRS, no official SDK existed. Given the small footprint of the API, a quick SDK was started until an official SDK is released.

*NOTE* This SDK exists as a temporary solution until an official SDK is released from Amazon or a community-standard SDK is developed. This SDK supports V2 of the DRS API.
